# Biggest towns in various RPGs #

The purpose is to get ideas for unique and special buildings, to see what makes these large towns interesting without just being a scaled-up version of a small town.

### List of special buildings ###

- **barracks**: super school and tavern
- **estate**: super house and tavern
- **guild**: faction-based super school; can send adventurers on quests that you don't set
- **prison**: where bad adventurers are kept; possibly bailed by other adventurers at cost, or sent on quests for free. Requires police force.
- **temple**: faction-based super school and inn; improves happiness and length of stay for converted adventurers

### Building subtypes ###

- arena (adventurers can fight each other and/or monsters)
- den (normal building that was taken over by an evil entity, must be restored by questing adventurers)
  - crypt (undead)
  - dungeon (combat)
  - illusion (mage specialty)
  - trap (thief specialty)
- guild
  - fighters
  - mages
  - thieves (improves intel, can increase number of thieves in town!)
- inn
  - hotel (for rich people)
- prison
  - magical (for mages)
- shop
  - mart (sells everything)
  - magic
  - stall (very basic, less space taken but no seating, limited stock)
  - tanner (leather armour)
  - temple
