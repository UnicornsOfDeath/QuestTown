# Biggest towns in various RPGs #

The purpose is to get ideas for unique and special buildings, to see what makes these large towns interesting without just being a scaled-up version of a small town.

### Special buildings and subtypes ###

- barracks (super school and tavern)
- casino (gambling, possibly tavern/food services)

  - mortuary (advanced cemetary)
